# skills-garden
REST API for my personal project. Work in progress.

It is proven that efficient learning requires repeating the material. I designed this app to help myself with learning. It features:
- garden: the place when you can store topics, categorized in fields
- sources: to each topic you can add text source or an url link
- schedule: the app will keep track of what you've learned & plan revisions for your topics
- journal: here you can write and describe yous learning process. It also logs most important to user actions taken by the system
